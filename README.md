<p align = "justify">This repository is based on several Bioinformatics problems which I've been solved during my bioinformatics course. You'll find a couple of files and the descriptions of those files are given below:<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>BioInformatics project: </b>The goal of this project is to complement a DNA strand. First, a strand was taking as an input. Then adenine was replaced with thymine and vice versa. On the other hand, guanine is replaced with cytosine and vice versa. Finally, the program will show the complementing DNA strand against the input.</li>
  <li><b>DNA to RNA</b></li>
  <li><b>DNA</b></li>
  <li><b>Project2</b></li>
  <li><b>Transcribing DNA into RNA</b></li>
</ul></p>
